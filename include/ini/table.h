/** the following routines implement a simple key-value table store
 *  with arbitrary (e.g. not necessarily null-terminated) blobs as
 *  keys and void pointers as values.
 *  
 *  the table may reorganize on insertion (i.e. with table_ensure)
 *  and getter functions return pointers to the values which may
 *  change if the table is reorganized; thus their lifetime should
 *  be considered until the table is modified.
 *  
 *  additionally, pointers are invalid after the table is free'd
 *
 *  the table is not reorganized when keys are popped, note that
 *  this means table memory is not reclaimed when it is shrunk.
 *
 *  there is no built-in multithreading protection in the table,
 *  thus functions that may reorganize must be externally synchronized.
