/* the following library routines connect INI functionality
 * to the table functionality in table.h
 *
 * they are implemented by nesting table structures such that
 * the toplevel table (representing the set of sections) has
 * values that are the tables for each section.
 *
 * the section tables have values of type struct ini_entry to facilitate
 * the INI requirement of length-bound, potentionally null-containing values.
 *
 * the zero-length toplevel key is the global table.
 *
 * the ini_XXX_free functions provided here are simplifications
 * of the general table_free function and in fact wrap that function
 * with pre-made callbacks to free the data allocated by ini_table_read
